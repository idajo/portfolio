                    We conducted field research,
                    including interviews and other testing methods, to evaluate their current website. We used "How

                    also introduced to design systems.

                    into the code, similar to how we structured components in Figma. We got introduced to Netlify and

                    We worked with storyboarding to plan our videos. This included sketching scenes and creating a clear

                    shoots, which helped us structure our content production.

                    Recording audio with an external microphone was an important part of the project. We conducted

                    microphones to capture clear and sharp sound, which enhanced the quality of our video.

                    We were introduced to Adobe Premiere Pro for video editing. We learned to cut and edit our

                    replacing the audio from the main interview with external audio clips to achieve better sound
                    quality. Adding transitions and
                    effects, as well as adjust audio levels. We also used Adobe After Effects to create animations,
                    which we integrated with
                    LottieFiles.

                    We redesigned a company's website, by using Figma to gather our research in one place where we all
                    had access, allowing
                    us to visually design the layouts and structure of the company's website. It was fun to collaborate
                    on a shared project.
                    We used Trello to organize our plan, tasks, and to-do lists.

                    variables and we got introduced to Git and Github.

                    We used GitHub to collaborate effectively on projects as a team, allowing us to code simultaneously.
                    This was harder
                    than we expected, and we faced several challenges with it. But we found that multiple branches and
                    forks had been
                    created, which were resolved with expert help by our teacher.

                <p>
                    We used Adobe Illustrator to design our graphic and game components. We learn how to use Illustrator
                    tools to create
                    vector graphic and how to implement design principles, like rule of thirds to create depth to our
                    design. I chose a
                    design based on the kawaii style, with soft pastel colors and a handwritten like typography to
                    create a indbydende
                    brugerinterface.

                    With CSS, we added movement and life to our game. By experimenting with keyframes, transitions and
                    transform, we created
                    different animation effects to enhance the userexperiance.

                    We got introduced to JavaScript and how to create interactive and dynamic gaming experience. We
                    learned how to use event
                    listeners to create actions such as starting the game with a button click. We implemented functions
                    to handle
                    interactions with good and bad objects, update points and lives, and end the game upon “game over”.

                    We started with research and developing ideas, creating mind maps and exploring existing content on
                    the internet to find
                    a concept. I researched meditation, spa, hotel, and other wellness sites and ultimately chose a
                    modern style with soft,
                    muted colors like blue, beige, and white. The typography was elegant and easy to read, which, along
                    with soothing
                    images, created a calm and inviting atmosphere."

                <p>We learned to use Figma to design and prototype user interfaces. Through hands-on exercises, we
                    created low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes, allowing us to
                    visualize and test our designs.

                    We focused on userfriendly design methods and principles. By studying user behavior, conducting user
                    research, and
                    performing various tests such as the 5-second test, think-aloud test, BERT-test, and Lighthouse
                    test, we ensured that
                    our designs met the users needs and expectations.
